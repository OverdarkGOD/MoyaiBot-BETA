# MoyaiBot
A Discord bot

Hello, 

In order for this to work, you must create a folder for the program. In that folder, create another folder for the cog (.py) files. Moyai2021.py is not a cog file.
Moyai2021.py will be outside of the cog folder but will be inside of the main folder. I know, tongue twister. 

Make sure wherevever you put the files for the program matches the directory path listed in the code of the program. If not, the program will not work. 

Make sure you install the requiste modules asked from the "Problems" console.
  ex: In Visual Studio Code, click the "Terminal" tab and click "New Terminal" and a console window will appear. In that console type "pip install (module)".
  (module) will be the module you are required to install to make the bot work. The issue will be displayed in the "problems console" for you to install. 
    
If you run into any issues, send me a message and I will be happy to help.

Edit (5/26): This repository of Moyai has been declared a beata version of the program. A newer version of Moyai is available.
